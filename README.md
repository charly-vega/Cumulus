# Cumulus
Cumulus is a **free**, open-source replacement for [CloudApp](http://www.getcloudapp.com/) that **utilizes your own S3 for storage**. Cumulus is a simple app that runs quietly in the background and uploads any screenshots you take. A link to that screenshot will automatically be copied to your clipboard.

*Note: This app is still a work in progress. Check back soon!*
